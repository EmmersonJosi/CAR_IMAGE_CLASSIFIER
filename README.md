# car_image_classifier
PROJECT:In this project, I will build a classification model through Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) to predict car images of Nissan, Mercedes-benz, Volkswagen, Porsche, Proton, Toyota, Volvo, Perodua, Tesla, Bmw, Mini, Rolls-royce

Business Understanding:Image recognition has many important applications ranging from delivery service, payment processing, and public safety.

For example in criminal investigations pivotal questions such as "What kind of car was the suspect driving?" could be the difference between solving a case and not solving case. Application of cameras with high speed image recognition capability at key highway intersections enables to match the car to the model/type and help police find the criminal faster.

Join me on this journey of developing a competitive car image classification model. This dataset can also be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benlaw/car-models-b
